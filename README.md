# BSAOFBC
 
Used online Bootstrap templates to design a website for the Bangladeshi Community Club at my university and hosted online using IONOS. Utilized FileZilla to upload files to server. Integrated HubSpot (CRM) for user registration and send customized bulk emails. This is a team work with three other club members
